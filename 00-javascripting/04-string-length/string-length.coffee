# You will often need to know how many characters are in a string.

# For this you will use the .length property. Here's an example:

# var example = 'example string';
# example.length

# # NOTE

# Make sure there is a period between example and length.

# The above code will return a number for the total number of characters in the string.

# ## The challenge:

# Create a file named string-length.js.

# In that file, create a variable named example.

# Assign the string 'example string' to the variable example.

# Use console.log to print the length of the string to the terminal.

example = 'example string'
console.log example.length
