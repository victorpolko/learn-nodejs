# To keep things organized, let's create a folder for this workshop.

# Run this command to make a directory called javascripting (or something else if you like):

# mkdir javascripting

# Change directory into the javascripting folder:

# cd javascripting

# Create a file named introduction.js:

# touch introduction.js or if you're on windows, type NUL > introduction.js

# Open the file in your favorite editor, and add this text:

# console.log('hello');

console.log 'hello'
