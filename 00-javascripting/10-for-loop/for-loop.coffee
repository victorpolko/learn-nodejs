# For loops look like this:

# for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
#   // log the numbers 0 through 9
#   console.log(i)
# }

# The variable i is used to track how many times the loop has run.

# The statement i < 10; indicates the limit of the loop.
# It will continue to loop if i is less than 10.

# The statement i++ increases the variable i by 1 each loop.

# ## The challenge:

# Create a file named for-loop.js.

# In that file define a variable named total and make it equal the number 0.

# Define a second variable named limit and make it equal the number 10.

# Create a for loop with a variable i starting at 0 and increasing by 1 each time through the loop. The loop should run as long as i is less than limit.

# On each iteration of the loop, add the number i to the total variable. To do this, you can use this statement:

# total += i;

# After the for loop, use console.log() to print the total variable to the terminal.

total = 0
limit = 10
total += i for i in [0...limit]
console.log total
