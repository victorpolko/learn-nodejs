# A string is any value surrounded by quotes.

# It can be single or double quotes:

# 'this is a string'

# "this is also a string"

# # NOTE

# Try to stay consistent. In this workshop we'll only use single quotes.

# ## The challenge:

# For this challenge, create a file named strings.js.

# In that file create a variable named someString like this:

# var someString = 'this is a string';

# Use console.log to print the variable someString to the terminal.

someString = 'this is a string'
console.log someString
