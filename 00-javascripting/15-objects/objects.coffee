# Objects are lists of values similar to arrays, except values are identified by keys instead of integers.

# Here is an example:

# var foodPreferences = {
#   pizza: 'yum',
#   salad: 'gross'
# }

# ## The challenge:

# Create a file named objects.js.

# In that file, define a variable named pizza like this:

# var pizza = {
#   toppings: ['cheese', 'sauce', 'pepperoni'],
#   crust: 'deep dish',
#   serves: 2
# }

# Use console.log() to print the pizza object to the terminal.

pizza =
  toppings: ['cheese', 'sauce', 'pepperoni']
  crust: 'deep dish'
  serves: 2

console.log pizza
